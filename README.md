## <a id="about-the-project"></a> üìö About The Project

This project provides a detailed comparative study between two powerful classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**. The primary goal is to predict rainfall based on a comprehensive weather dataset. The notebook meticulously walks through data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and rigorous evaluation, offering insights into which model might be more suitable for such a task.

## <a id="features"></a> ‚ú® Features

* **Extensive Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and drops irrelevant columns to ensure data quality.
* **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Utilizes both `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` to transform categorical data into a machine-learning-ready format.
* **Data Splitting**: Divides the cleaned and encoded dataset into training and testing subsets for unbiased model evaluation.
* **Logistic Regression Implementation**: Trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression model, a widely used linear classification algorithm.
* **Random Forest Classifier Implementation**: Trains and evaluates a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning method known for its robustness.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Provides a side-by-side comparison of the accuracy and confusion matrices for both models, highlighting their predictive strengths and weaknesses.

## <a id="dataset"></a> üìä Dataset

The project utilizes the `weatherAUS.csv` dataset, which contains daily weather observations from various Australian weather stations. This dataset is rich with features relevant to rainfall prediction.

**Key Features (after preprocessing):**
* `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Rainfall`, `Evaporation`, `Sunshine`
* `WindGustSpeed`, `WindSpeed9am`, `WindSpeed3pm`
* `Humidity9am`, `Humidity3pm`, `Pressure9am`, `Pressure3pm`
* `Cloud9am`, `Cloud3pm`, `Temp9am`, `Temp3pm`
* `RainToday` (Binary: Yes/No), `RainTomorrow` (Target Variable: Yes/No)
* **One-Hot Encoded Categorical Features**: `Location`, `WindGustDir`, `WindDir9am`, `WindDir3pm`
